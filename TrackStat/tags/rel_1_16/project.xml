  <description>This plugin for slimserver makes it possible to rate your songs and also handles statistic data about
  play counts and last played time. The ratings and statistic data is stored in a separate database table
  which will not be cleared during a complete rescan of the music library. Ratings and statistic data can also
  be imported from an iTunes Music Library xml-file. You can make backup/restore of your ratings and statistic data
  to a separate xml file to make it easier to backup the information to other storages. To be able to view the ratings
  when listening to music it is recomended to install the patched MusicInfoSCR plugin provided at http://erland.homeip.net/download.
  Se README.txt file provided with this plugin for more details.
